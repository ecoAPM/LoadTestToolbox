# ecoAPM Contribution Guidelines

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing!

This document represents a general set of guidelines to help make the process of community contributions as smooth as possible for all parties involved.

#### Please read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) prior to participating
   - This is the standard "Contributor Covenant" used throughout all ecoAPM codebases, and widely across the OSS landscape
   - Building a strong, professional, caring, and empathetic community is paramount in our goal as an OSS company

#### Discussions about changes should happen in an issue before creating a pull request
   - While a change may make sense for a specific use case, it may not match the larger goals of the project as initially formulated by the original contributor
   - Prior discussion can help give direction to how a feature or bug fix could best be implemented to meet everyone's needs

#### Follow the standard issue template formats for reporting bugs and requesting new features
   - These make reading, understanding, and triaging issues much easier 

#### Commit quality code with detailed documentation to help maximize PR review effectiveness
   - All new or modified functionality should have unit tests covering the logic involved
   - All PR checks (e.g. automated tests, code quality analysis, etc.) should be passing before a PR is reviewed
   - Commit messages should be English (Canadian/UK/US are all acceptable) in the present tense using an imperative form (see existing commits for examples)
   - Please do not reference GitHub issue numbers or PR numbers in git commit messages

#### Multiple smaller, atomic PRs are preferable to single larger monolithic PRs
   - This may take longer to get the full changeset merged, but will provide for a much smoother feedback process
   - Please reference any related issue numbers in the body of all PR descriptions so that GitHub links them together
